# metaobj
Metaobj creates, validates, and initializes objects at runtime. A domain model can now be defined more easily than ever before in an ubiquitous language such as YAML or JSON. Under the hood, metaobj uses object metadata defined in a configuration file such as YAML to create, validate, and intialize an object.
